Procedure to deploy Database lab within a container:

1. Login to base1 machine by ssh username@10.4.12.21
	e.g.	ssh yogesh@10.4.12.21

2. Become a root user by
	sudo su -

3. To see the running containers execute
	vzlist

4. You can see the available os templates inside /vz/template/cache

5. Then create the container with a new id, which is followed by previous CTID's.
	Ipaddress: Format for ip address is 10.4.(first two digit of CTID).(digits after two digits fo CTID)

	e.g.	vzctl create 14192 --ostemplate ubuntu-12.04-x86-64-proxy-apache-php-git --ipadd 10.4.14.192 --hostname database.test.vlabs.in

6. Add nameserver for the container:
	e.g.	vzctl set --nameserver 10.4.12.157

	This step may not be required if you have used pre-configured os template.

7. Start the container by vzctl start CTID
	e.g.	vzctl start 14192

8. Enter inside the container by vzctl enter CTID
	e.g.	vzctl enter 14192

9. Now you are inside the container, clone the source code of the lab from bitbucket into /home/developer folder. Before cloning you may want to check the size of the lab, and
   accordingly change the diskspace of the containter. To check the lab size type "du -sh labdirectory", and you can check the container size in /etc/vz/conf/14192.conf file.

	e.g.	git clone https://yogeshiiith@bitbucket.org/virtuallabs/cse06-cse06-07.git


10. Disk space got filled, so increased the diskspace to 4G using vzctl set 14192 --diskspace 4G --save command.

11. Install all the dependencies from the dependencies.txt file present inside scripts folder, using sudo apt-get install.

12. Sage installation gets failed due to disk space deficit. So increased disk space to 7 GB.

13. Modified path for make command in sage-install script. And then run sage-install script. This process takes more than 7 hrs.

14. Starting sage by running python-scripts/start_sage file.

15. /var/www got deleted, after sage installation. So installing apache2 again. Ran scripts/build.sh file. 

16. Modified python scripts build and create_sagenb and then run it.



Tasks:

1. Template for database containing sage installed with all the redirection done.

2. Daemon for sage, put the start of sage in init.

3. Update labspec for nitk, database, 

4. Do we need developer user now, as ovpl has to create the user if it is not using the customized template ?
