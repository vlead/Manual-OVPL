General procedures to deploy lab within a container:

1. Login to base1 machine by ssh username@10.4.12.21
	e.g.	ssh yogesh@10.4.12.21

2. Become a root user by
	sudo su -

3. To see the running containers execute
	vzlist

4. You can see the available os templates inside /vz/template/cache

5. Then create the container with a new id, which is followed by previous CTID's.
	Ipaddress: Format for ip address is 10.4.(first two digit of CTID).(digits after two digits fo CTID)

	e.g.	vzctl create 14191 --ostemplate ubuntu-12.04-x86-64-proxy-apache-php-git --ipadd 10.4.14.191 --hostname nitk.test.vlabs.in

6. Add nameserver for the container:
	e.g.	vzctl set --nameserver 10.4.12.157

	This step may not be required if you have used pre-configured os template.

7. Start the container by vzctl start CTID
	e.g.	vzctl start 14191

8. Enter inside the container by vzctl enter CTID
	e.g.	vzctl enter 14191

9. Now you are inside the container, clone the source code of the lab from bitbucket into /home/developer folder. Before cloning you may want to check the size of the lab, and
   accordingly change the diskspace of the containter. To check the lab size type "du -sh labdirectory", and you can check the container size in /etc/vz/conf/14192.conf file.

	e.g.	git clone https://yogeshiiith@bitbucket.org/virtuallabs/cse07-firstmining.git

10. Check dependencies for the labs in the file dependencies.txt which is usually present in scripts directory, and install all the dependencies. Or if initialise script is there run 		that one, instead of manually installing. 

12. Make sure to restart Apache Server.

13. The last step may be to move the content of build folder to /var/www, if it is not already moved. And also run chmod 777 to give permission to folders.
