1. Install apache2 and php5.

2. Move the content of mech26-mech26/lab/mfvlab to /var/www/.

3. You need to make home.php as default page for apache. To do this add following line 
"DirectoryIndex home.php"
in /etc/apache2/httpd.conf file.



Another way:

1. Clone source code.

2. If apache is pre installed in the template make sure to uninstall it before installing xampp, by following steps:
	sudo apt-get remove apache2
	sudo apt-get purge apache2*
	sudo apt-get autoremove
	sudo apt-get update

3. You need to install "python-software-properties" to be able to add ppa to apt-get sources by "sudo apt-get install python-software-properties"

4. Installing xampp
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:upubuntu-com/web
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install xampp

5. You need to make home.php as default page for apache. To do this add the following line in /opt/lampp/etc/httpd.conf file.
"DirectoryIndex home.php"

Also to disable the directory browsing you should replace "Indexes" term with "-Indexes", in same httpd.conf file.

6. Place the content of mfvlab inside /opt/lampp/htdocs.

7. Restart the xampp by "sudo /opt/lampp/lampp restart"
