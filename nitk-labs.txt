NIT-K labs deployment

On Base2 there is an inactive container that still holds sources for labs:
  ctid: 12199, ip-addr: 10.4.12.199,  name: sources.virtual-labs.ac.in
You may want to start the container before navigating. The lab sources are organized as follows:
 
   labs/chem05/bzr
      |-- nitk/trunk
            |-- README.txt
            |-- scripts
            |-- src
            |-- suratkal
      |-- suratkal


We need to build the contents of this dorectory: /labs/chem05/bzr/nitk/trunk/suratkal

IMPORTANT: We need to first increase the target container's disk space to about 8GB before copying the contents. 
  vzctl set 14186 --diskspace 5G

IMPORTANT: 
We see a new requirement in the case of labs that are content heavy, much like this NITK lab. It is not necessary for a lab's content to come from a Git repository. We need to accommodate cases where the content needs to be either copied from a remote location (scp, wget, curl, ftp, sftp, ...). We need to have a method in labspec to take care of this aspect.



(1)
set http_proxy and https_proxy in /etc/apt/apt.conf.
Add the following two lines
acquire::http::proxy "http://proxy.iiit.ac.in:8080";
acquire::https::proxy "http://proxy.iiit.ac.in:8080";

(2)
If you normally use sudo to run apt-get you will need to login as root first for this to work unless you also add some explicit environment settings to /etc/sudoers:
Defaults env_keep = "http_proxy https_proxy ftp_proxy"	

(3)
Runtime requirements
apt-get install php5
apt-get install mysql-server
apt-get install phpmyadmin
apt-get install apache2

    (a) While installing mysql-server you will be prompted for a password. Be consistent in the password you provide. We have used 'Suratkal' as the password everywhere.

    (b) Enter the following line in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
        Include /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf

(4) sudo adduser developer sudo

(5)
Initialize the database that holds the lab's content. 
    mysql -u root -p -Bse "CREATE DATABASE suratkal" 
    mysql -u root -p suratkal < backup/suratkal.sql


Suggested Changes and Enhancements to the Deployment Procedure
(1) We need to modify makefile so that the contents of src/solve directory are MOVED to /var/www directory. Currently, a directory named 'build' is crated in /var/www. This is not required.

(2) Note that in (1) above, we recommend moving content instead of copying 

(3) As a part of the lab initialization procedure we need to have scripts that create MySql database and update apach2.conf etc.
